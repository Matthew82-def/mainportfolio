            As a web developer with over two years of hands-on experience in
            HTML, JavaScript, React, and Express.JS, I am always willing to
            learn new tricks to design, develop, and maintain websites tailored
            for both clients and researchers. My passion is in troubleshooting,
            debugging, and analyzing website issues, and I am known for my
            ability to provide innovative ideas and best practices to enhance
            website security. Having a keen understanding of website design
            principles and user experience, I have been instrumental in ensuring
            optimal website compatibility across different platforms and
            browsers. I am now seeking to leverage these skills in a challenging
            role to help your organization achieve its digital objectives.
